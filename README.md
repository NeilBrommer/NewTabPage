# Start New Tab Page

A new tab page that shows a list of grouped bookmarks. The background changes
based on the time of day.

[Live site](https://start.neilbrommer.com/)

I use Danny Care's [Bitday](https://danny.care/portfolio/bitday/) wallpaper set
for the above site.

This project uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/),
[JQuery](https://jquery.com/), and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).
